          This property indicates the number of in-use slots of available slots
          for GPIOs. The typical example is something like this: the hardware
          register is 32 bits wide, but only 18 of the bits have a physical
          counterpart. The driver is generally written so that all 32 bits can
          be used, but the IP block is reused in a lot of designs, some using
          all 32 bits, some using 18 and some using 12. In this case, setting
          "ngpios = <18>;" informs the driver that only the first 18 GPIOs, at
          local offset 0 .. 17, are in use.  For cases in which there might be
          holes in the slot range, this value should be the max slot number-1.
