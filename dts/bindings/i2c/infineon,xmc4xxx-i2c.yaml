  Infineon XMC4XXX I2C

  This driver configures the USIC as an I2C device.

  Example devicetree configuration with an adt7420 temperature sensor
  connected on the bus:

  &usic1ch1 {
      compatible = "infineon,xmc4xxx-i2c";
      status = "okay";

      pinctrl-0 = <&i2c_scl_p0_13_u1c1 &i2c_sda_p3_15_u1c1>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      scl-src = "DX1B";
      sda-src = "DX0A";
      interrupts = <94 1>;

      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;

      clock-frequency = <I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD>;
      adt7420@48 {
          compatible = "adi,adt7420";
          reg = <0x48>;
      };
  };

  The pinctrl nodes need to be configured as open-drain and
  hwctrl should be disabled:

  &i2c_scl_p0_13_u1c1 {
      drive-strength = "strong-sharp-edge";
      drive-open-drain;
      hwctrl = "disabled";
  };

  &i2c_sda_p3_15_u1c1 {
      drive-strength = "strong-soft-edge";
      drive-open-drain;
      hwctrl = "disabled";
  };

compatible: "infineon,xmc4xxx-i2c"

      Connects the I2C clock line (USIC DX1 input) to a specific GPIO pin.
      The USIC DX1 input is a multiplexer which connects to different GPIO pins.
      Refer to the XMC4XXX reference manual for the GPIO pin/mux mappings.

      Connects the I2C data line (USIC DX0 input) to a specific GPIO pin.
      The USIC DX0 input is a multiplexer which connects to different GPIO pins.
      Refer to the XMC4XXX reference manual for the GPIO pin/mux mappings.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: |
      IRQ number and priority to use for interrupt driven by I2C.
      Each USIC must use a certain interrupt range:
      USIC0 = [84, 89]
      USIC1 = [90, 95]
      USIC2 = [96, 101]

  pinctrl-0:
    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for SCL, SDA signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: <signal>_p<port>_<pin>_<peripheral inst>

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c_scl_p5_2_u2c0 &i2c_sda_p5_0_u2c0>;
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true
