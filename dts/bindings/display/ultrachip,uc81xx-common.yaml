include: [spi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: RESET pin.

        The RESET pin of UC81xx is active low.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: DC pin.

        The DC pin of UC81xx is active low (transmission command byte).
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: BUSY pin.

        The BUSY pin of UC81xx is active low.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured

    Child nodes describe refresh profiles. Each refresh profile
    specifies a set of voltages used to drive the refresh
    cycle. Refresh nodes are optional and are used to override
    defaults loaded from the controllers OTP memory.

    The driver typically looks for the following child nodes:

      - 'full' - Normal / full refresh.
