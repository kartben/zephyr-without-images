API Documentation
#################

Welcome to the Zephyr Project's
:abbr:`API (Application Programing Interface)` documentation.

This section contains the API documentation automatically extracted from the
code. To ease navigation, we have split the APis in nanokernel APIs and
microkernel APIs. If you are looking for a specific API, enter it on the
search box. The search results display all sections containing information
about that API.

The use of the Zephyr APIs is the same for all platforms and boards.
