Networking
**********

* Introduce system calls for BSD socket APIs.
* Add IPv4 autoconf support. This adds support for IPv4 link-local addresses (169.254.*.*)
* Add TLS and DTLS support to BSD socket API. They are configured via setsockopt() API.
* Add support for IEEE 802.1AS-2011 generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP) for ethernet networks. A sample application is created to show how to interact with gPTP code.
* Add support for PTP clock driver. This driver will be used by gPTP supported ethernet drivers.
* Add Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TX support.
* Add support for managing Qav credit-based shaper algorithm.
* Add generic TX timestamping support.
* Add carrier detection support to ethernet L2 driver.
* Add support for having vendor specific ethernet statistics.
* Add getter support to ethernet management interface.
* Add promiscuous mode support to network interface. A sample application is created that shows how to use the user API for getting all network packets. The native_posix ethernet driver supports promiscuous mode at this point.
* Add support for Link Layer Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR). LLMNR is used in Microsoft Windows networks for local name resolution.
* Add API to net_pkt to prefill a network packet to a pre-defined value.
* Add IEEE 802.1Qav support to Atmel GMAC ethernet driver.
* Add hardware TX timestamping support to Atmel GMAC ethernet driver.
* Add multiple hardware queue support to Atmel GMAC ethernet driver.
* Add gPTP support to Atmel GMAC ethernet driver.
* Add support for TI SimpleLink WiFI offload driver.
* Add support for randomized but stable MAC address in NXP MCUX ethernet driver.
* Add extra prints to net-shell for ethernet based network interfaces. The supported features and priority queue information is printed.
* Add and fix string to integer conversions in net-shell.
* Allow user to configure MAC address filters into ethernet devices.
* Catch network interface ON and OFF events in DHCPv4 and renew address lease if we re-connected.
* Remove forever timeouts when waiting a new network buffer to be available.
* Relay network interface up/down command from net-shell to Linux host for native_posix ethernet driver.
* No need to join IPv6 solicited node multicast group for Bluetooth IPSP supported nodes.
* Allow external program to be started for native_posix ethernet driver. This allows for example startup of wireshark when zeth is created.
* Network packet priority and traffic class fixes and clarifications.
* Lower memory consumption in net by using packed enums when applicable.
* Correctly notify net_app server when TCP is disconnected.
* Register OpenThread used unicast and multicast IPv6 addresses for network interface.
* Enable Fast Connect policy for TI SimpleLink ethernet driver.
* Fix ieee802154 simulator driver channel/tx power settings.
* Handle large IPv6 packets properly.
* Enable gPTP support in native_posix, NXP mcux and Atmel GMAC ethernet drivers. The native_posix ethernet driver gPTP support is only for testing purposes.
* Network configuration (net_config) library split from the net_app library.
  (This change requires updating application configs to refer to corresponding
  NET_CONFIG_* options instead of NET_APP_*).
* Moving all layer 2 (L2) network code into subsys/net/l2 directory.
* Add MSS option on sending TCP SYN request.
* Fix TCP by processing zero window probes when our receive window is 0.
* IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv6, ARP code refactoring and cleanup.
* IPv6 address lifetime fixes.
* IPv6 fragmentation fixes.
* ARP fixes when using VLAN.
* Timeout too long lasting ARP requests.
* DHCPv4 fixes and timeout management refactoring.
* TCP retry, RST packet handling, and memory leak fixes.
* IP address print function enhancements.
* HTTP fix when sending the last chunk.
* MQTT fixes.
* LWM2M cleanups and fixes.
* Fix cache support in Atmel GMAC ethernet driver.
* Fix NXP MCUX ethernet driver to detect carrier lost event.
* Port native API echo-server/echo-client samples to BSD sockets API, with TLS/DTLS support.
* Handle out-of-buf situations gracefully in echo-client and echo-server sample applications.
