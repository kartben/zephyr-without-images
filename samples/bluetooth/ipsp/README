IPSP sample application

== Supported Boards ==

This application currently only works with HCI based firmware since it
requires L2CAP channels support, so in order to use it with an arduino 101
the prj_nimble.conf shall be used:

$ make CONF_FILE=prj_nimble.conf BOARD=arduino_101

== Testing with Linux host ==

To test IPSP please take a look at samples/net/README, in addition to running
echo-client it is necessary to enable 6LowPAN module in Linux with the
following commands:

$ modprobe bluetooth_6lowpan
$ echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_enable

Then to connect:

echo "connect <bdaddr> <type>" > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_control

Once connected a dedicated interface will be created, usually bt0, which can
then be used as following:

$ echo-client -i bt0 <ip>
