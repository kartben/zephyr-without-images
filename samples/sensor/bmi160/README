BMI160 sample applications
--------------------------

For Arduino101 users:
=====================

Currently, the GPIO DW controller driver does not allow for AON GPIO interrupts
to be received on ARC core. Hence, IPM is used to relay the interrupts from x86
to ARC core.

Hence, Arduino101 users have to build and flash both x86 and arc applications
in order to test the trigger functionality.

By default, the applications are configured to build for Arduino101.


For other boards:
=================

For boards that have BMI160 connected separately, not in a Curie module (as
it's the case for Arduino101), the ARC application is all that's needed,
provided the user configures the driver to use a standalone GPIO.

Also, if the BMI160 is connected to the x86 core, the arc application makefile
has to be changed accordingly.
