This sample application illustrates how to use the I2C APIs from
Zephyr. The slave device (STTS751) is present in Quark SE devboard
so no wiring instructions are required in order to get this sample
working.

This is a very simple application which reads the value from the
temperature register from STTS751 sensor.
