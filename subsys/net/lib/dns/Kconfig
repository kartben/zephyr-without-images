config DNS_RESOLVER_ADDITIONAL_BUF_CTR
	int
	prompt "Additional DNS buffers"
	default 0
	help
	Number of additional buffers available for the DNS resolver.
	The DNS resolver requires at least one buffer. This option
	enables additional buffers required for multiple concurrent
	DNS connections.

config DNS_RESOLVER_ADDITIONAL_QUERIES
	int
	prompt "Additional DNS queries"
	range 0 2
	default 1
	help
	Number of additional DNS queries that the DNS resolver may
	generate when the RR ANSWER only contains CNAME(s).
	The maximum value of this variable is constrained to avoid
	'alias loops'.

config DNS_RESOLVER_MAX_SERVERS
	int "Number of DNS server addresses"
	default 1
	help
	Max number of DNS servers that we can connect to. Normally one
	DNS server is enough.

config DNS_NUM_CONCUR_QUERIES
	int "Number of simultaneous DNS queries per one DNS context"
	range 1 NET_MAX_CONTEXTS
	default 1
	help
	This defines how many concurrent DNS queries can be generated using
	same DNS context. Normally 1 is a good default value. Each query
	will use one network context.

config NET_DEBUG_DNS_RESOLVE
	bool "Debug DNS resolver"
	default n
	help
	Enables DNS resolver code to output debug messages
