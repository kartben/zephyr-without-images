/**
 * \defgroup timer Timer library
 *
 * The Contiki kernel does not provide support for timed
 * events. Rather, an application that wants to use timers needs to
 * explicitly use the timer library.
 *
 * The timer library provides functions for setting, resetting and
 * restarting timers, and for checking if a timer has expired. An
 * application must "manually" check if its timers have expired; this
 * is not done automatically.
 *
 * A timer is declared as a \c struct \c timer and all access to the
 * timer is made by a pointer to the declared timer.
 *
 * \note The timer library is not able to post events when a timer
 * expires. The \ref etimer "Event timers" should be used for this
 * purpose.
 *
 * \note The timer library uses the \ref clock "Clock library" to
 * measure time. Intervals should be specified in the format used by
 * the clock library.
 *
 * \sa \ref etimer "Event timers"
