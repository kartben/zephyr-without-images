config MICROBIT_DISPLAY

	depends on BOARD_BBC_MICROBIT
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Enable this to be able to display images and text on the 5x5
	  LED matrix display on the BBC micro:bit.

config MICROBIT_DISPLAY_PIN_GRANULARITY
	bool "Access the GPIO on a per-pin instead of per-port basis"
	depends on MICROBIT_DISPLAY
	help
	  By default, the micro:bit display driver will update the GPIO
	  pins of the display (pins 4 through 15) by accessing the entire
	  GPIO port. This is done for efficiency, however it may interfere
	  with other peripherals connected to the same GPIO port. Select
	  this option if other peripherals are connected to the same GPIO
	  port.
