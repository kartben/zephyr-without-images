	  Enables support for using Nordic Semiconductor nRF51 Bluetooth
	  LE chips with a custom firmware. The API for this is a subset of
	  the normal Bluetooth API (include/bluetooth/*.h). This driver can
	  only be enabled if CONFIG_BLUETOOTH has not been enabled.

	  A fundamental assumption that the driver makes is that it is
	  run on an architecture with the same ABI (e.g. struct packing
	  & endianess) as the nRF51 chip. The driver cannot be used on
	  any architecture that doesn't fulfill this requirement.

	  Size of the receiving fiber stack. This is the context from
	  which all event callbacks to the application occur. The
	  default value is sufficient for basic operation, but if the
	  application needs to do advanced things in its callbacks that
	  require extra stack space, this value can be increased to
	  accomodate for that.
