	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate over UART with custom
	  defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data and all
	  aspects of received protocol data are handled by application via
	  work method provided.  This driver differs from the pipe UART driver
	  in that callbacks are executed in a different work queue and data is
	  passed around in k_pipe structures.

config MODEM_CONTEXT

	help
	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate with an interface
	  using custom defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data
	  and all aspects of received protocol data are handled by application
	  work method provided.  This driver combines abstractions for:
	  modem interface, command handler, pin config and socket handling each
	  of which will need to be configured.

	  Enabling this setting will turn on VERY heavy debugging from the
	  modem context helper.  Do NOT leave on for production.

	help
	  Activate shell module that provides modem utilities like
	  sending a command to the modem UART.
