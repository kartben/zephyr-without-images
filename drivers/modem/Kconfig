	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate over UART with custom
	  defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data and all
	  aspects of received protocol data are handled by application via
	  work method provided.  This driver differs from the pipe UART driver
	  in that callbacks are executed in a different work queue and data is
	  passed around in k_pipe structures.
