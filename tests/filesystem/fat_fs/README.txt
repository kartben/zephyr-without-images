Title: Zephyr File System Demo

Description:

Demonstrates basic file and dir operations using the Zephyr file system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building and Running Project:

The demo will run on Arduino 101 and will use the on-board SPI flash.

    make BOARD=arduino_101

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:

Problems caused by out-dated project information can be addressed by
issuing one of the following commands then rebuilding the project:

    make clean          # discard results of previous builds
                        # but keep existing configuration info
or
    make pristine       # discard results of previous builds
                        # and restore pre-defined configuration info
