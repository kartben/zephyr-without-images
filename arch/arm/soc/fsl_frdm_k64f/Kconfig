config K64_CORE_CLOCK_DIVIDER
	int
	prompt "Freescale K64 core clock divider"
	default 1
	help
	This option specifies the divide value for the K64 processor core clock
	from the system clock.

config K64_BUS_CLOCK_DIVIDER
	int
	prompt "Freescale K64 bus clock divider"
	default 2
	help
	This option specifies the divide value for the K64 bus clock from the
	system clock.

config K64_FLEXBUS_CLOCK_DIVIDER
	int
	prompt "Freescale K64 FlexBus clock divider"
	default 3
	help
	This option specifies the divide value for the K64 FlexBus clock from the
	system clock.

config K64_FLASH_CLOCK_DIVIDER
	int
	prompt "Freescale K64 flash clock divider"
	default 5
	help
	This option specifies the divide value for the K64 flash clock from the
	system clock.

config WDOG_INIT
	def_bool y
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	help
	This processor enables the watchdog timer with a short timeout
	upon reset. Therefore, this requires that the watchdog be configured
	during reset handling.

config PRESERVE_JTAG_IO_PINS
	bool "Freescale FRDM-K64F JTAG pin usage"
	depends on PINMUX
	default y
	help
	The FRDM-K64F board routes the PTA0/1/2 pins as JTAG/SWD signals that
	are used for the OpenSDAv2 debug interface.  These pins are also routed to
	the Arduino header as D8, D3 and D5, respectively.
	Enable this option to preserve these pins for the debug interface.
